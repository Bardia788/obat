# Standard Parts

This site gives a short overview of parts that have been selected and share
potential for reuse in other circuits.

- [AD8531/AD8532/AD8534][AD8531]
  Opamp, Rail-to-Rail, No-Phase-Reversal, Single suppy, high output current

!!! info
    Observe maximum ratings, especially the rated power and output current.
    Output is not shortcircuit protected.

- [IL300][IL300]
  Linear Optocoupler
  check if appropriate for usage of galvanic isolation

- [AMC1100][AMC1100]
  Differential Isolation Amplifier
  check if appropriate for usage of galvanic isolation
